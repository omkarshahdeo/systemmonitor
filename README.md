Steps to run the system monitor:

1. create an environment: run python3 -m venv venv           
                          source venv/bin/activate

2. install the dependencies: pip install psutil, rich, textual
3. run monitor.py
4. run app.py
this should open a h-top like interface showing info about your cpu, memory and running processes.
